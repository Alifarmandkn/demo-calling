Avoid rewriting lines that are not relevant for the current change.

- Don't reformat or refactor unrelated things from what you are being asked about.
- Don't split endpoint grouping, it's structured the that way for security.
- When we generate pages, always make sure to use enenties as well. 
- Every component must be using preact and signals for state management. Never change state away to any other way than using signals.
- Always write your typescript structured after S.O.L.I.D. best practices principles.
