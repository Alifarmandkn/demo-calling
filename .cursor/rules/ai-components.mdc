# Usage of components

- Any time you write in a file, you are only allowed to use and import material components from SPA.Client/src/components/ui/material. Use the wrappers and NEVER edit the wrappers themselves unless you are asked to specifically.
- Every TSX file must be written in preact and be properly typed with typescript

- Components MUST be single purposed and do one thing. Given complexity increases in a component, then it must be broken down to multiple separate files.
