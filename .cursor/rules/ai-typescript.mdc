# Writing components with typescript

- Always make sure that files are single purpose files. If not, then organise them in smaller files and a sensible folder structure within SPA.Client/src/components

- Always make sure that functions follow the linter rules from .eslintrc.json

- DO NOT add functionality that is not relevant to the request or feature, if you are in doubt ask first.
